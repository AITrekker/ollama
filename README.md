# CAP fhL 2025: Hands-On AI â€“ Running and Building with Local LLMs

## Overview
AI isnâ€™t just for research teamsâ€”itâ€™s for every developer. This hands-on session is designed to help developers, managers, and product owners learn how to **run multiple local LLMs, compare responses, and integrate AI into real-world applications.**

## What Youâ€™ll Learn
- How to set up and run **local LLMs** using [Ollama](https://ollama.ai)
- How to compare model responses to understand their strengths and weaknesses
- How to write scripts for **theming, summarization, and AI-aware features**
- How to start incorporating **agentic scenarios** in your productsâ€”no prior AI expertise required

## Prerequisites

### **Clone the Session Repository**
Run the following command to clone the repository containing example scripts:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/ollama-learning-session.git
cd ollama-learning-session
```

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Pull Ollama models:
   ```sh
   ollama run phi
   ollama run llama3.2:1b
   ollama run deepseek-r1:1.5b
   ```
3. Create a temprary folder:
   ```sh
   mkdir temp
   ```
5. Run temporary local web server
   ```sh
   cd temp
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
3. Run the example summarization script:
   ```sh
   python summarize.py --input "sample_text.txt"
   ```

## Ollama Usage Guide
Ollama provides a CLI for managing and running models. Here are some key commands:

| Command               | Description |

| `ollama help`        | Show help menu |
| `ollama ps`          | List running models |
| `ollama list`        | List available models |
| `ollama run <model>` | Run a model |
| `ollama stop <model>` | Stop a running model |
| `ollama rm <model>`  | Remove a model |
| `/bye` | Exit the chat |
