# CAP fhL 2025: Hands-On AI â€“ Running and Building with Local LLMs

## Overview
AI isnâ€™t just for research teamsâ€”itâ€™s for every developer. This hands-on session is designed to help developers, managers, and product owners learn how to **run multiple local LLMs, compare responses, and integrate AI into real-world applications.**

## What Youâ€™ll Learn
- How to set up and run **local LLMs** using [Ollama](https://ollama.ai)
- How to compare model responses to understand their strengths and weaknesses
- How to write scripts for **theming, summarization, and AI-aware features**
- How to start incorporating **agentic scenarios** in your productsâ€”no prior AI expertise required
